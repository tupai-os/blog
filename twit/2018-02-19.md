# This Week In Tupai: 2018-02-19

This week, the first week of serious development, has seen some major improvements in Tupai; primarily due to the fact that the project now exists. We have active ports for both i386 and x86_64, as well as paging, VGA, exception, PIC, GDT and IDT support. We're also using GRUB as the primary bootloader for now.
